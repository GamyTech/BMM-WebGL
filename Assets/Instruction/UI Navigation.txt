This is the details about how the ui navigation system works.
The UI navigation is used to jump from a selected ui element to the next one or to trigger a click action only with the keyboard.

Such as it responds from keyboard's inputs, this system is only active on standalone and WebGL.

Fisrt, all menu widgets have as public parameter a fisrt selectable UI selectable element which is the starting element that will be selected when the widget is loaded. It can be null.

For every selectable elements in every widgets you have to specifiy an explicit navigation order.

By pressing Tab, you will switch to the next down selectable wich is active and selectable.
You can also set a selectable on the right navigation slot to jump on an other navigation loop.
Shift will navigate to previous element in the navigation loop.

By pressing Enter:
	if the selected element is a button, you will pressed it.
	if it is  a toggle, it will go on On position and select the next element.
	if it is a InputField and the next element is a button, you will directly press that button.
